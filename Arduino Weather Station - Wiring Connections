1. LCD 16x2 Display (with I2C module)  
- VCC → 5V (Power)  
- GND → GND (Ground)  
- SDA → A4 (I2C Data)  
- SCL → A5 (I2C Clock)  

*If the LCD does not have an I2C module, you will need 6-8 additional wires for direct connection to the Arduino.*

2. Temperature & Humidity Sensor (DHT11)  
- VCC → 5V (Power)  
- GND → GND (Ground)  
- DATA → D2 (or any digital pin)  
---

3. Barometric Pressure Sensor (BMP180)  
- VCC → 3.3V (Do NOT connect to 5V to avoid damage)  
- GND → GND (Ground)  
- SDA → A4 (I2C Data)  
- SCL → A5 (I2C Clock)

4. Active Buzzer  
- Positive (+) wire → Any digital pin (e.g., D9)  
- Negative (-) wire → GND  

---

-- Notes:  
- Use a Breadboard to connect all GND and VCC wires easily.  
- If the LCD or BMP180 does not work, try changing the I2C address in the code (0x27 or 0x3F).

# Weather Station Project

This project utilizes an Arduino to create a weather station that collects and displays real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed. Designed for educational purposes, it allows users to monitor environmental conditions via an LCD interface.

## Features
- **Sensor Integration:** Collects accurate weather data using various sensors.
- **Real-Time Display:** Shows current weather conditions on an LCD screen.
- **Data Logging:** Future implementation for logging data over time.
- **Wireless Communication:** Plans for remote access to weather data.

## Technologies Used
- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
- DHT11/DHT22 (Temperature and Humidity Sensor)
- BMP180 (Barometric Pressure Sensor)
- Anemometer (Wind Speed Sensor)
- LCD Display

# Weather Station Project

## Overview

This project is designed to create a weather station that collects and displays real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. It serves as an efficient, low-cost solution suitable for personal or educational use.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Display**: Continuously shows updated weather data.
- **Accurate Measurements**: Utilizes reliable sensors for precise readings.
- **User Notifications**: Alerts users about critical weather conditions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple interface for easy operation.

## Components Used

- **Microcontroller**: Arduino Uno
- **Temperature and Humidity Sensor**: DHT11
- **Barometric Pressure Sensor**: BMP180
- **Display Unit**: 16x2 Character LCD
- **Connecting Wires**: Jumper Wires
- **Power Supply**: USB Power Source
- **Breadboard**: For building and testing circuits

## Installation and Setup

1. Connect all the components according to the circuit diagram.
2. Install the required libraries in the Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the Arduino code to the board using the Arduino IDE.
4. Power the Arduino with a USB cable.
5. Test the system to ensure it displays the correct weather data.

## How It Works

- The sensors collect weather data.
- The microcontroller processes the data.
- The LCD displays the current weather conditions.
- Alerts are sent for critical weather conditions.

## Usage

### **Weather Station Project Code**

This project is for a weather station that reads temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed using various sensors. It displays the data on an LCD screen, logs the data to an SD card (optional), and provides alerts for critical weather conditions such as high temperatures or wind speeds.
